abstract: 'Combining multiple sensors enables a robot to maximize its perceptual awareness
  of environments and enhance its robustness to external disturbance, crucial to robotic
  navigation. This paper proposes the FusionPortable benchmark, a complete multi-sensor
  dataset with a diverse set of sequences for mobile robots. This paper presents three
  contributions. We Ô¨Årst advance a portable and versatile multi-sensor suite that
  offers rich sensory measurements: 10Hz LiDAR point clouds, 20Hz stereo frame images,
  high-rate and asynchronous events from stereo event cameras, 200Hz inertial readings
  from an IMU, and 10Hz GPS signal. Sensors are already temporally synchronized in
  hardware. This device is lightweight, selfcontained, and has plug-and-play support
  for mobile robots. Second, we construct a dataset by collecting 17 sequences that
  cover a variety of environments on the campus by exploiting multiple robot platforms
  for data collection. Some sequences are challenging to existing SLAM algorithms.
  Third, we provide ground truth for the decouple localization and mapping performance
  evaluation. We additionally evaluate state-of-theart SLAM approaches and identify
  their limitations. The dataset, consisting of raw sensor measurements, ground truth,
  calibration data, and evaluated algorithms, will be released.'
