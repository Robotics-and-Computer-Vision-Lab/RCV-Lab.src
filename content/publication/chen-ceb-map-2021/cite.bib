 abstract = {For safe visual navigation, areas with high localization errors should be concentrated and could be further reﬁned by additional mapping operations. Given an environment map, we propose to predict the visual localization error and hence to either improve the navigation performance or call an additional mapping to reﬁne the built map. Previous work adopts the uncertainty of landmarks for the error prediction. In our work, we take into account both the spatial distribution of visual landmarks and the uncertainty of landmarks. Our main idea is that standing at one place, a good spatial distribution of landmarks means a sufﬁcient enough visible landmarks from all views at that place, i.e., enough landmarks under arbitrary view-direction. Combining the spatial distribution and the uncertainty of landmarks, we propose a new framework to predict the error of visual localization. Furthermore, we show that additional mapping in the area with high predicted error can signiﬁcantly improve the visual localization precision. Experimental results show that there is a strong relationship between the predicted error and the real error, of which the absolute value of correlation coefﬁcient is between 0.707 to 0.915. We apply our method to conduct an optimal reﬁning policy on the built map and the experimental results show the improved localization precision. Applications on navigation test verify the superiority of our proposed method.},
