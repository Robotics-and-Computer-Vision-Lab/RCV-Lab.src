abstract: As the basic of visual tracking and mapping in VSLAM systems, keyframe selection
  plays an essential role. In previous works, keyframes are selected according to
  a series of view change-based judgement that aim to provide the referenced tracking
  markers and enhance the current visual tracking. However, the enrichment of environment
  information is always ignored, which results to the lacking of complete environment
  representation, and the failure of closed-loop detection or submap alignment. In
  this paper, we propose a keyframe selection judgement based on the deep image global
  descriptor and information enrichment. The image is expressed by an illumination
  invariant descriptor for an appropriate statical abstraction; an information enrichment
  judgement is proposed based on the deep descriptor, by which the environment representation
  can be completed. The experimental results are conducted showing the advantage of
  our method in terms of image representation and information enrichment. The proposed
  information-based keyframe selection judgement can raise the tracking precision
  and the loop-closed detection rate.
