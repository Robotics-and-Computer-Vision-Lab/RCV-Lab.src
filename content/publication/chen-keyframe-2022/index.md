abstract: As the basics of Visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (VSLAM), keyframes
  play an essential role. In previous works, keyframes are selected according to a
  series of view change-based strategies for short-term data association (STDA). However,
  the texture enrichment of frames is always ignored, resulting in the failure of
  long-term data association (LTDA). In this paper, we propose an information enrichment
  selection strategy with an information occupancy grid model and a deep descriptor.
  Frame is expressed by a deep global descriptor for a statistical explainable abstraction,
  in which the texture enrichment is indicated. Based on the abstraction, an information
  occupancy grid model is established to measure the information enrichment and the
  potential LTDA ability. Evaluations on variant datasets are conducted, showing the
  advantage of our proposed method in terms of keyframe selection and tracking precision.
  Also, the statistical explainability of the deep descriptor is provided. The proposed
  keyframe selection strategy can improve LTDA and tracking precision, especially
  in situations with repeated observations and loop-closures.
