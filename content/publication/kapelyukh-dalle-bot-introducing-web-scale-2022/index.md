abstract: 'We introduce the first work to explore web-scale diffusion models for robotics.
  DALL-E-Bot enables a robot to rearrange objects in a scene, by first inferring a
  text description of those objects, then generating an image representing a natural,
  human-like arrangement of those objects, and finally physically arranging the objects
  according to that image. The significance is that we achieve this zero-shot using
  DALLE, without needing any further data collection or training. Encouraging real-world
  results with human studies show that this is an exciting direction for the future
  of web-scale robot learning algorithms. We also propose a list of recommendations
  to the text-to-image community, to align further developments of these models with
  applications to robotics. Videos are available at: https://www.robot-learning.uk/dall-e-bot.'
