abstract: 'To perform household tasks, assistive robots receive commands in the form
  of user language instructions for tool manipulation. The initial stage involves
  selecting the intended tool (i.e., object grounding) and grasping it in a task-oriented
  manner (i.e., task grounding). Nevertheless, prior researches on visual-language
  grasping (VLG) focus on object grounding, while disregarding the ﬁne-grained impact
  of tasks on object grasping. Task-incompatible grasping of a tool will inevitably
  limit the success of subsequent manipulation steps. Motivated by this problem, this
  paper proposes GraspCLIP, which addresses the challenge of task grounding in addition
  to object grounding to enable task-oriented grasp prediction with visuallanguage
  inputs. Evaluation on a custom dataset demonstrates that GraspCLIP achieves superior
  performance over established baselines with object grounding only. The effectiveness
  of the proposed method is further validated on an assistive robotic arm platform
  for grasping previously unseen kitchen tools given the task speciﬁcation. Our presentation
  video is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1wfYQPeAXU.'
