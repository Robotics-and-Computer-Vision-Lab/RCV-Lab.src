abstract: '2D LiDAR SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is widely used in
  indoor environments due to its stability and flexibility. However, its mapping procedure
  is usually operated by a joystick in static environments, while indoor environments
  often are dynamic with moving objects such as people. The generated map with noisy
  points due to the dynamic objects is usually incomplete and distorted. To address
  this problem, we propose a framework of 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM without manual control
  that effectively excludes dynamic objects (people) and simplify the process for
  a robot to map an environment. The framework, which includes three parts: people
  tracking, filtering and following. We verify our proposed framework in experiments
  with two classic 2D-LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms in indoor environments. The results
  show that this framework is effective in handling dynamic objects and reducing the
  mapping error.'
