abstract: Compared to widely used LiDAR-based mapping in autonomous driving field,
  image-based mapping method has the advantages of low cost, high resolution, and
  no need for complex calibration. However, the image-based 3D mapping depends heavily
  on the texture richness and always leaves holes and outliers in low-textured areas,
  such as the road surface. To this end, this paper proposed a novel semantically
  guided Multi-View Stereo method for dense 3D road mapping, which integrates semantic
  information into PatchMatch-based MVS pipeline and uses image semantic segmentation
  as soft constraints in neighbor views selection, depth-map initialization, depth
  propagation, and depth-map completion. Experimental results on public and our own
  datasets show that, with the help of semantics, the proposed method achieves superior
  completeness with comparable accuracy for 3D road mapping compared to state-of-the-art
  MVS methods.
