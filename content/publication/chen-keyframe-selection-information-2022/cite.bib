 abstract = {As the basic of visual tracking and mapping in VSLAM systems, keyframe selection plays an essential role. In previous works, keyframes are selected according to a series of view change-based judgement that aim to provide the referenced tracking markers and enhance the current visual tracking. However, the enrichment of environment information is always ignored, which results to the lacking of complete environment representation, and the failure of closed-loop detection or submap alignment. In this paper, we propose a keyframe selection judgement based on the deep image global descriptor and information enrichment. The image is expressed by an illumination invariant descriptor for an appropriate statical abstraction; an information enrichment judgement is proposed based on the deep descriptor, by which the environment representation can be completed. The experimental results are conducted showing the advantage of our method in terms of image representation and information enrichment. The proposed information-based keyframe selection judgement can raise the tracking precision and the loop-closed detection rate.},
