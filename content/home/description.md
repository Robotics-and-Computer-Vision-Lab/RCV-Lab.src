# Welcome

The Robotics and Computer Vision Laboratory (RCV Lab) is home to a Shenzhen Key Laboratory - 深圳市机器人视觉与导航重点实验室（筹）. The Key Laboratory is located in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), in Shenzhen, China; it is headed by Professor ZHANG Hong (张宏), a Chair Professor at SUSTech.   The RCV Lab was founded in 2020 by Professor Zhang when he returned to China after working overseas in academia for over 30 years.  The RCV Lab currently  support research conducted by its 25+ members including post-doctoral fellows, PhD students, MSc students, as well as research associates.    The lab is well equipped with a variety of robotic devices and sensors, and well-funded with grants from both the public and private sources.

The RCV Lab is dedicated to the development of algorithms for autonomous robot navigation, robot manipulation, and human-robot interaction. Our research aims to develop autonomous or self-driving vehicles that can navigate reliably, indoor and outdoor, to perform useful operations such as assisting people and delivering objects.  We are particularly interested in using vision as the primary source of information for a robot to perceive its environment in creating its representations and making intelligent decisions. At the same time, we also investigate other forms of sensing including LiDAR and polarization imaging that can complement visual sensing. Current research projects include: 
- simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 
- semantic scene understanding, 
- human-robot interaction, and
- perception with the polarization camera

Further details of the research projects can be found under the research page.
