title: Human-robot Interaction
summary: "We are interested in developing robots capable of making interaction with human beings. This goal requires robots to have capabilities of low-level perception (sensing, detection, recognition and tracking) and high-level understanding (prediction and interaction). We dedicate to endowing robots with these abilities in two human-robot-interaction scenarios: robot person following  (RPF) and task-aware manipulation. RPF is to endow a robot to follow its master accurately and persistently, which is a basic and vital function for many human-robot-interaction applications. We have developed a vision-based RPF system that can solve partial occlusion and target loss problems in complex environments. Currently, we focus on improving life-long person identification ability of the robot. Task-aware manipulation refers to a robot physically manipulating the environment to fulfill a designated task. The whole process often consists of task-aware grasp synthesis, task-aware manipulation trajectory planning, and path planning of a mobile base (optionally). We are currently developing a mobile manipulator system which is capable of traversing and manipulating unconstructed environments (e.g., apartment, office) according to humansâ€™ natural language instructions (e.g., table setting, object retrieval)."
