**Introduction**: In robotics, semantic scene understanding (SSU) refers to the interpretation and understanding of visual scenes in order for downstream robot tasks execution. It involves extracting high-level information from multiple types of sources, such as images, videos, point clouds, and natural language, and building contextual correspondences among elements within the information. Especially in our group, we tackle problems of scene graph generation, semantic rearrangement, semantic grasping, semantic mapping, active SLAM, and change detection. The ultimate goal is to endow robots with the ability to perceive and reason at the human level, and meanwhile interact with the unconstructed environment supported by the semantic knowledge. SSU is closely related to the concept of “Embodied AI”, but we are more interested in bringing SSU algorithms to real-world robotic applications.
