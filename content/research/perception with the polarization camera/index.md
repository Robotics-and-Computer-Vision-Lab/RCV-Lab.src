**Introduction**: We propose the perspective phase angle (PPA) model as a superior alternative to the orthographic phase angle (OPA) model for accurately utilizing polarization phase angles in 3D reconstruction with perspective polarization cameras. The PPA model also allows planar surface estimation from single-view polarization images. This model serves as the foundation of polarimetric 3D reconstruction. <br> Our current research of polarization centers around exploiting geometric cues of polarization for non-lambertian surfaces reconstruction and recognition, aiming to create reliable perception system for mobile robot. Non-lambertian including glass and smooth metal are still challenging to traditional passive sensors like RGB cameras, and active sensors like depth cameras. Polarization cameras provides compensated information for traditional sensors. Polarization is one of property of light. Unpolarized light can be polarized by transmission, reflection, scattering and refraction and the polarization phase angle depends on the geometries and materials of the polarizers. Therefore, polarization information provides extra cues for recovering the geometries and materials of surfaces.
