### About Me
I am a Chair Professor in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).   Prior to joining SUSTech, I was a Professor in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta for over 30 years. I received my BSc degree from Northeastern University (USA) and my PhD from Purdue University. I had an 18-month post-doctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania before coming to Canada.  I am holding an adjunct appointment at the University of Alberta.

### Research
My research interests include robotics, computer vision, and image processing. I have worked in a number of areas in robotics and, for the past 10+ years, my focus has been on visual robot navigation. While working in Canada.  In 2003-17, with support from the Canadian federal and provinncial governments, I held an NSERC Industrial Research Chair to conduct research in computer vision and image processing that addressed the practical challenges facing Alberta's mining industry. As a member of the NSERC Strategic Network on Robotics, I worked closely with Canadian academic colleagues and industrial partners on mobile robotics research. I am active in the international robotics community, in a variety of roles in ICRA and IROS communities, as well as other IEEE RAS sponsored conferences.  In recognition of my research contributions, I am elected a Fellow of IEEE, and a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering.
