### About Me
My name is Chao Tang. I am currently a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Dr. Hong Zhang in Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Lab at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). Prior to joining SUSTech, I obtained my M.S. degree from Georgia Tech under the supervision of Dr. Patricio Vela. 

### Research
My research interests are on the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and deep learning. Concretely, my research focuses on robotic manipulation and grasping using vision and language, semantic scene understanding, mobile manipulaiton. The goal is to build intelligent robots that can physically and naturally interact with human and the unstructured world.
