### Research
{{< youtube mhQnRS0X_RA "Research Introduction">}}

My research interests involve robotic manipulation and grasping, mobile manipulation, human-robot interaction, and semantic reasoning for robots. The ultimate goal is to develop autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world with the same level of Intelligence as humans.
