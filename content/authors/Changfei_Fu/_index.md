### About Me
Changfei Fu received her B.S. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from CUMT, China University of Mining and Technology in 2020. He was a recipient  of the first class scholarship at CUMT and the excellent award with a bronze medal of the international Robotic Competition Robomaster2018, and the first class award in Robomaster2018. He like basketball and singing. He began to play basketball from when he was a primary school student. Changfei Fu's research interest is in robotic vision and navigation, especially those algorithms that can make a robot run in real-world.

### Research
{{< youtube bMMvqL4aALk >}}

VT&R(Visual Teach and Repeat) is a system to make the wheel robot tracking the trajectory it was taught by human. In the phase of teaching, the robot is controlled by human to move on a trajectory on which the VSLAM system will reconstruct the environmental geometry. In the phase of repeating, the robot will autonomously tracking the trajectory it was taught with the localization service provided by the geometrical map.
