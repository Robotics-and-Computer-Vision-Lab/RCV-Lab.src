### About Me
Changfei Fu received his B.S. degree in Electronic and Information  Engineering from CUMT, China University of Mining and Technology in  2020. He was a recipient of the first class scholarship at CUMT and the  excellent award with a bronze medal of the international Robotic  Competition Robomaster2018, and the first class award in Robomaster2019. Changfei Fu’s research interests are in robotic vision and navigation,  especially those algorithms that can make a robot run in real-world. He  is good at basketball and singing. He began to play basketball since he  was a primary school student, joined the basketball team of EI collage  in CUMT and received a bronze medal in the basketball game held by PCNL, Peng Cheng National Lab.

### Research
{{< youtube bMMvqL4aALk "Research Introduction" >}}

VT&R (Visual Teach and Repeat) is a system to make the wheel  robot track the trajectory it was taught by human. In the phase of  teaching, the robot is controlled by operator to move along a trajectory on which the VSLAM system will reconstruct the environmental geometry.  In the phase of repeating, the robot will autonomously track the  trajectory it was taught with the localization service provided by the  geometrical map.
