### Research
{{< youtube bMMvqL4aALk >}}

VT&R(Visual Teach and Repeat) is a system to make the wheel robot tracking the trajectory it was taught by human. In the phase of teaching, the robot is controlled by human to move on a trajectory on which the VSLAM system will reconstruct the environmental geometry. In the phase of repeating, the robot will autonomously tracking the trajectory it was taught with the localization service provided by the geometrical map.
