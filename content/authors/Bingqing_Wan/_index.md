### About Me
I am a undergraduate visiting research student at Prof. Hong Zhang's group in 2022. Then, I am going back to Canada to continue my junior year in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, pursuing a major in robotics engineering and a minor in artificial intelligence engineering. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn for any potential collaborations.

### Research

My current research interests lie in the fields of domestic mobile robots and autonomous driving, including:
1. Learning-based motion planning
2. Keyframe-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping
3. Semantic mapping
