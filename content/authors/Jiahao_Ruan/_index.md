### About Me
I am a visiting student in Robotics and Computer Vision Lab at Southern University of Science and Technology since 03/2022. I am currently working toward the M.E. degree in  Mechanical Engineering with the School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China. My research include visual SLAM and robot localization.

### Research
My research interests focus on visual localization and visual SLAM for robot navigation, including:

1. Learning-based visual localization
2. Object-level semantic SLAM 
3. Monocular depth estimation
