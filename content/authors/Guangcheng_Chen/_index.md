### About Me
I am a MSE student in Biomimetric and Intelligent Robotics Lab (BIRL) at Guangdong University of Technology, supervised by Prof. Hong Zhang, since 9/2020. Currently, I am a visiting student at Southern University of Science and Technology.

### Research
![research](authors_research/guangcheng_chen.gif "Research Introduction")

My research interests are focused on polarimetric imaging, including:
1. 3D reconstruction
2. inverse rendering
3. transparent object segmentation
