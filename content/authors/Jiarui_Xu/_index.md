### About Me
I am an undergraduate student in Robotics and Computer Vision Lab under the direction of Prof. Hong Zhang at Southern University of Science and Technology since 11/2020. Currently I am working on hardware acceleration on image processing. My future research interest will be on robot control and computer vision.
