**Large-scale Data Analysis**. Dr. He has worked on kernel approximation and large-scale data spectral analysis for more than ten years, and proposed several works such as parallel-computing for spectral clustering (2016, Pattern Recognition), error analysis (2017，Neurocomputing), optimal sampling (2018，IEEE Trans. on Image Processing), fast spectral clustering (2019，IEEE Trans. on Cybernetics) and applications (2017-2021) on robot computer vision and LiDAR analysis. Dr. He chaired two national grants, young and general programs, respectively, on this field.  

**Vision and/or LiDAR SLAM**: In IROS 2016, Dr. He proposed M2DP, a global point cloud descriptor for loop closure detection. This work was one of the start-up works in LiDAR applications for mobile robot and auto-driving, and is one of the most cited works in LiDAR loop closure detection. He has many works on loop closure detection and LiDAR+Visual SLAM since then. Considering Dr. He’s contributions on SLAM, He was appointed as the recipient of The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program of Guangdong.
