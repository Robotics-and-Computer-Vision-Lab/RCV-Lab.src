**Large-scale Data Analysis**. Dr. He has worked on kernel approximation and large-scale data spectral analysis for more than ten years, and proposed several works such as parallel-computing for spectral clustering (2016, Pattern Recognition), error analysis (2017，Neurocomputing), optimal sampling (2018，IEEE Trans. on Image Processing), fast spectral clustering (2019, IEEE Trans. on Cybernetics), doubly stochastic clustering (2023, IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology), Sinkorn/Wassertein distance acceleration (2024, IEEE Trans. on Consumer Electronics), Nystrom acceleration (to appear, IEEE Trans. on Big Data) and applications (2017-2025) on robot computer vision and LiDAR analysis. Dr. He chaired two national grants, young and general programs, respectively, on this field.

**Vision and/or LiDAR SLAM**: In IROS 2016, Dr. He proposed M2DP, a global point cloud descriptor for loop closure detection. This work was one of the start-up works in LiDAR applications for mobile robot and auto-driving, and is one of the most cited works in LiDAR loop closure detection. He has many works on loop closure detection and LiDAR+Visual SLAM since then, including TIV, TASE, RAL, TMech, Robotica, ICRA and IROS. Considering Dr. He’s contributions on SLAM, He was appointed as the recipient of The Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program of Guangdong.
