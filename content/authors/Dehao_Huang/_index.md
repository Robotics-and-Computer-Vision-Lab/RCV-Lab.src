### About Me
I am a MSE student in Robotics and Computer Vision Lab under the direction of Prof. Hong Zhang at Southern University of Science and Technology since 09/2022. I received the B.E. degree in information engineering from the South China Normal University, in 06/2022. My research focuses on robotic visual perception.

### Research
{{< youtube mhQnRS0X_RA >}}

My research interests focus on visual scene understanding for robotic manipulation, including mapping and planning: 
1. Object-level semantic mapping 
2. Learning-based motion planning 
3. Tabletop object rearrangement
