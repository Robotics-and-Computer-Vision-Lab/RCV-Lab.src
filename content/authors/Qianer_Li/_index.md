### About Me

I am currently a postgraduate student in the Robotics and Computer Vision (RCV) Lab at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), under the supervision of Prof. Hong Zhang. During my undergraduate studies, my research focused on multimodal emotion recognition in conversation. My current research interests lie in embodied intelligence.
