### About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate with Robotics and Computer Vision Lab and [Intelligent Autonomous Driving Center (IADC)](https://iadc.ust.hk/), co-supervised by Chair [Prof. Hong ZHANG](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhangh33/en/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and [Prof. Ming LIU](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 

I received my B.E degree (Magna Cum Laude) in information engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology, in 06/2021. My research focuses on **Vision-Based** **Localization** **and** **Map** **Update** **for** **Long-Term** **Navigation** **in** **Changing** **Environments**.



### Research

Currently my research interests focus on long-term visual localization in dynamic and changing indoor environments. Specifically, I am focusing on developing a long-term visual localization system. In the meantime, I work with a quadruped robot and a low-speed autonomous vehicle.
