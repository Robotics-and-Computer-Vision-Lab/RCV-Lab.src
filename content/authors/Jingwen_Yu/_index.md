### About Me
Hi there, I am Jingwen YU (中文名：于靖文), a Ph.D. candidate at [Cheng Kar-Shun Robotics Institute (CKSRI)](https://ri.hkust.edu.hk/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and affiliated with [Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). I am co-supervised by [Prof. Ping TAN](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/pingtan) and [Chair Prof. Hong ZHANG (SUSTech)](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/?view=%E5%BC%A0%E5%AE%8F&jsid=18&lang=en). I work closely with [Dr. Jianhao JIAO](https://gogojjh.github.io/), [Dr. Hengli WANG](https://hlwang1124.github.io/), [Mr. Hanjing YE](https://medlartea.github.io/), and [Mr. Chao TANG](https://mkt1412.github.io/). I was with the Intelligent Autonomous Driving Center (IADC) and [RAM-Lab](https://ram-lab.com/), led by Prof. [Ming LIU](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/LIU-Ming/eelium), where I got the chance to work on autonomous vehicles and quadruped robots. Besides, I am also interested in task-oriented grasping, check out my [personal website](https://jingwenyust.github.io/) for more details.

### Research
Currently, my research interests focus on long-term visual localization in dynamic and changing indoor environments. Specifically, I am focusing on developing a long-term visual localization system. In the meantime, I work with a quadruped robot and a low-speed autonomous vehicle.

1. Visual Loop Closure Detection and Verification (视觉回环检测和验证)
