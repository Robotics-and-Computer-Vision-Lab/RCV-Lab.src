### About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student with Robotics and Computer Vision Lab and [Intelligent Autonomous Driving Center (IADC)](https://iadc.ust.hk), co-supervised by Chair [Prof. Hong ZHANG](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhangh33/en/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and [Prof. Ming LIU](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=ming-liu-eelium) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Guangzhou (HKUSTGZ). 

I received my B.E degree (Magna Cum Laude) in information engineering from Southern University of Science and  Technology, in 06/2021. My research focuses on the localization and mapping of mobile robots. 

### Research
![research](authors_research/jingwen_yu.gif "Research Introduction")

Currently my research interests focus on long-term visual localization in dynamic and changing indoor environments. Specifically, I am focusing on developing a long-term visual localization system on a quadruped robot.

1. Long-term visual localization in semi-static indoor environments
3. Dense scene reconstruction under dynamic environments
