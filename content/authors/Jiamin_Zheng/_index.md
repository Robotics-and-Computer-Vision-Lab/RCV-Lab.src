### About Me
I'm working toward the M.S. degree in electronic science and technology with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology since 2021. I received the B.S. degree in transportation engineering from Zhejiang University in 2019. My research interests include scene change detection, long-term visual simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM).

### Research
