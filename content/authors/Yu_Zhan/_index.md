### About Me
My name is John (Yu Zhan). I am a first-year Master's student in RCV Lab under the supervision of Prof. Hong Zhang. I previously graduated from Wuhan University in China with a B.E. in Microeletronics. My research interests involve human-robot interaction and robot navigation. Currently I'm working on an interesting problem called robot person following.

### Research
![research](authors_research/yu_zhan.gif "Research Introduction")

I'm researching on robot person following. Specifically, it's about how to make a UGV robustly recognize and follow a designated person. I currently use an omnidirectional camera to enhance the robot's perception.
