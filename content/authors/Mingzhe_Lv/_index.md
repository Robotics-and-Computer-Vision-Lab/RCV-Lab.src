### About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics and Computer Vision Lab under the supervision of Prof. Hong Zhang in a joint program between the Pengcheng Laboratory and Southern University of Science and Technology from 09/2021. I received a B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology in China, and an M.S. degree in the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on learning-based visual simultaneous localization and mapping.

### Research
