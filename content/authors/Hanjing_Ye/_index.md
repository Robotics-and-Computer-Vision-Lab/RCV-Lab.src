### About Me

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Robotics and Computer Vision Lab](https://rcvlab.eee.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Hong ZHANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), since September 2022. My research is centered around Robotics, with a special focus on SLAM and Computer Vision. At present, I am developing a ‘Robot Person Following’ system, a sophisticated setup that encompasses detection, tracking, re-identification, planning, and control modules. My aim is to enhance robotic companionship, creating systems that are as reliable and attentive as a faithful pet, thereby pushing the boundaries of user-oriented robotics technology.

### Research

#### Person Re-Identification for Robot Person Following

Proposed a life-long person identification module which could keep identifying the master even under severe domain-drift condition with online continual learning.

#### Robot Person Following Under Partial Occlusion

Proposed a vision-based robot person following system which endows the mobile robot with an ability of following the master even under partial occlusion based on a novel hybrid location approach.
