### About Me
I am currently a Ph.D. student in Robotics and Computer Vision Lab under the direction of Prof. Hong Zhang at Southern University of Science and Technology since 2022.09. I received the B. Eng. degree and the Master degrees in the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology in 2019 and 2021 respectively, supervised by Prof. Hong Zhang. From 2020.11 to 2022.09, I am a visiting student in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology.

My research focuses on Robotics, SLAM and Computer Vision. Recently, I am working on Robot Person Following.

### Research
{{< youtube tO7XPJ_rPMA >}}
It's an attachment video submitted to the ICRA 2023, which is about our newest research on Robot Person Following.

Currently, my research focuses on Robot Person Following, which is a complicated system including multiple basic modules including detection, tracking, re-identification, control and so on. My ultimate goal is to make the robot look like a puppy following its master forever.
